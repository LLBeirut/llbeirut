# Linguistic Landscapes of Beirut (llbeirut)

The [__Linguistic Landscapes of Beirut__](http://llbeirut.org) digital project generated some 2000+ images of multilingual writing from the Lebanese capital during the 2015-16 academic year.

The original data was collected by smartphone using a form builder application known as [Fulcrum](http://Fulcrumapp.com).  At the point of capture, images were geolocated and data collectors described them using a bounded set of tags. Beginning in the summer of 2017, we are cleaning the data, transcribing the language found within the images and adding more finely granular description. The result is a multi-lingual and multi-script archive of contemporary Beirut's polyglossia.  Each image corresponds to a file in the human-readable serialization language, YAML.

The data published in the "Finished files" folder of this repository is published with a [CC 4.0 BY-NC license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/).
